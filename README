This kernel module creates the /sys/devices/platform/mts-io
enumeration of the features for the MTAC ENF (Xaptum ENF Access)
boards.

This driver requires the mtac.ko driver loaded first.  depmod should
take care of this.

Documentation for this board is here:

An init script can look in:
/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/mtac_enf.ko
to find the driver.
